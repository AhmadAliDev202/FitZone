### 📊 Usage of HTML and CSS

✅ **HTML:**

* Utilized for **semantic structuring** of the landing page, ensuring screen readers and crawlers can parse content efficiently.
* Clear separation of **header, hero, content sections, and footer** for modularity.
* All interactive elements (buttons, navigation links) are structured for future JavaScript integration.

✅ **CSS:**

* Formed the **core of this project**, handling layout, design, responsiveness, and visual presentation.
* Extensive use of:

    * **Custom CSS variables** for color management.
    * **Reusable utility classes** for padding, margins, and typography.
    * **Responsive units (`em`, `rem`, `%`)** for scalable design.
    * **Flexbox** for alignment and distribution of elements.
    * **Grid** where structured multi-column layouts were needed.
* Ensured **consistency in design** while keeping the CSS DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and scalable for future enhancements.

**Over 80% of the project effort went into crafting, testing, and refining the CSS** to achieve a clean, brand-accurate design across devices.
